1.0:
    - Arbitrarily declaring a `1.0` release to reboot versioning and updates
        - Hastily updated, apologies for missing any contributions!

    - Explicit Float support for ObjectPoint
    - TilesetTile collections are now explicit Dicts.
        This prevents long searches through lists of tiles
    - TMX support:
        - Groups, Text objects, Tile types (thanks to Jakub Kurłowicz)
        - Object IDs (thanks to Thorbjørn Lindeijer)
    - DotNetZip and other external Zlib support has been removed, and we now
      rely on `DeflateStream` with explicit header removal.
    - .NET core compatibility
        (Thanks to @yangmingzhe and @miaodadao)
    - TmxGroup class support for TMX groups
    - Generic input stream constructor support
    - Additional TMX field support:
        - Groups
        - ObjectGroup: id, text
        - Horizontal/vertical alignment


0.15:
    - lost to history
